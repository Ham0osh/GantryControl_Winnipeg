#r_c is measured as the x and y distance from the limit switch to the point that makes contact with limit switch when homed. To measure x distance move the z axis above the camera and measure the distance from limit switch to the point that would make contact with the limit switch.
r_c = 1100,700  # Position of camera (mm,mm)
phi_init = -150 # initial angle to start (degrees) #don't change
phi_final = 0   # final angle to finish (degrees) #don't change
N_phi = 30      # number of stops to make in phi
z_init =  0     # minimuz z to start(mm)
z_final = 600   # maximum z to finish(mm)
N_z = 6         # number of stops to make in vertical direction
scan_rad = 500  # size of radius to move around camera
